After you've installed iTerm2 with the Solarized theme,
run the following scripts to bring down more changes that will improve your theme:

$ cd ~
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_profile
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_prompt
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.aliases

Note: I have added the above files to this project in case you just want to grab them straight up and copy them over from this project
but you can also get the latest via curl above, up to you..quicker to just curl if you don't care
